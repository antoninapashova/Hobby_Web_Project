    <div class="row">
        <p>Here you can share your hobby or find one to have fun with or fill your free time. Hobbies allow you to
            discover interests outside of work.
            They allow you to be creative and try all sorts of new things.
            If you are bored with your old hobby, choosing another can make your
            creative juices flow again. Be sure to review
            your budget before choosing a new hobby, as some can be expensive.
            Don't push yourself, but you have many options, even if your budget is limited.

        <h2>Steps to find your hobby</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Upgrade on your current interests</h3>
                <p>See what interests you. Investigate what your free time takes when you have it.
                    Do you like reading books? You may want to try to write them. Do you like cold beer at the
                    end of the day? Maybe your hobby may be trying to brew beer at home. Turn what you already love into
                    a hobby.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Viewing your childhood</h3>
                <p>Remember what you loved as a child. Did you like racing bikes with friends? Did you really do comics?
                    Did you like to paint or paint? Think about what really excited you as a child and what you could
                    spend for hours</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Exploring new territory for ideas</h3>
                <p>
                    Visit a craft store. Take a walk around the craft store to see what hobbies are available.
                    You can find something you have never thought about, such as building airplanes or learning how to
                    work
                    with
                    clay.</p>
            </li>

        <h2>Advices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Before you get involved in your hobby, find a place to work on it and a place to store it, whether
                    indoors or outdoors. Even outdoor hobbies that need equipment will require storage space; these
                    hockey sticks, soccer balls, boots, bikes and tents have to go somewhere when you are not using them.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Buy used consumables, which is more environmentally friendly and saves you money. You can find some
                    used consumables in savings stores and online exchanges.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    After practicing a hobby for a while, you will become better at it. You can get to a point where the
                    hobby can pay off. For example, this can lead to selling arts and crafts, training other athletes,
                    writing articles, and training others, which is a good way to keep costs low.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Try three times a few times and see what you like. Your first experience may not be representative!
